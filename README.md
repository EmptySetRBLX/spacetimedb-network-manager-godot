# SpacetimeDB Network Manager for Godot 4.4+
Networkmanager script to use with Godot for SpacetimeDB. Equivalent to the one used in the Unity Tutorial: https://spacetimedb.com/docs/unity/part-1

Add to your Autoloads if you want to add/remove connections via GDScript.

To use with a connection add the below line after you build your connection:
 ```
SpacetimeDbNetworkManager.Instance.AddConnection(connection);
```
